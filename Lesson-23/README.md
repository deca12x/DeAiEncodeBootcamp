# Lesson 23: Building Blockchain-Enabled AI Agents

In this lesson, we will explore how to build autonomous AI agents that can interact with blockchain networks, handle tokenized transactions, and execute smart contract functions. We'll learn how to integrate Web3 capabilities into our AI agents and deploy them on decentralized infrastructure.
