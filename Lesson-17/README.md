  - Exercise 2: Deploy the token to Sepolia testnet
  - Exercise 3: Interact with the deployed contract

## Creating Your First Smart Contract

1. Visit [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/)
2. Select ERC20 token template
3. Configure token properties:
   - Set token name and symbol
   - Enable premint with desired amount
   - Add optional features (pausable, burnable, etc.)
4. Copy the generated code
5. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
6. Create new file and paste the code
7. Compile the contract
8. Deploy to Sepolia network:
   - Connect MetaMask
   - Select Injected Provider
   - Deploy contract
9. Interact with deployed contract:
   - View token balance
   - Transfer tokens
   - Test other enabled features

## The Ethereum Virtual Machine

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a powerful tool for decentralizing the execution of programs, like the token Smart Contract that we experimented a little while ago. This EVM can be applied for many different tasks for Decentralized Computing, especially for AI applications, but there are also many architectural limitations inherent to the decentralized nature of the blockchains that we need to consider for a proper implementation.
