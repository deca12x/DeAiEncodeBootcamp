## Blockchain Data Structures

For the EVM and all Smart Contracts running on it, the data should be entirely present either inside the **Blockchain Storage** or in the **Transaction Data**.

### Blockchain Storage

- **Block Structure**:
  - Header components
  - Transaction root
  - State root
  - Receipt root

- **Contract Storage**:
  - Storage slots and mapping ([Solidity Storage Layout](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html))
  - State variables ([State Variables](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/structure-of-a-contract.html#state-variables))
  - Persistent data structures ([Data Location](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#data-location))
  - Key-value storage ([Mappings](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#mapping-types))
  - Storage layout patterns ([Layout of State Variables in Storage](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html))

- **Transaction Properties**:
  - Input data encoding ([ABI Specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html))
  - Receipt logs ([Events and Logs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#events))
  - Transaction finality ([Blocks](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#blocks))
  - Reversion handling ([Error Handling](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#error-handling))
  - Event emission ([Events](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#events))

## Hands-on Experience

- Practical exercise:
  - Exercise 1: Implement a simple Storage Contract

## Oracles and External Data

Anything that the application needs to access that is not present in these data locations as pointed before, should be ported onchain first with the use of **Oracles**.

### Understanding Oracles

- **Oracle Networks**:
  - Understanding [Oracles](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/oracles/)
  - Oracle networks
  - Decentralization vs Quick Resolution vs Accuracy

### Oracle Implementation

- **Smart Contract Integration**:
  - Oracle interfaces
  - Data feeds
  - Request and receive patterns
  - Error handling

- **Security Considerations**:
  - Oracle manipulation
  - Data validation
  - Redundancy
  - Failure modes

## Verifiable Computation

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

- **Fundamentals**:
  - [zk-rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/)
  - Proof systems
  - Circuit compilation

- **Applications**:
  - Privacy preservation
  - Scalability solutions
  - Identity verification
  - Compliance proof

### Trusted Execution Environments

- **TEE Integration**:
  - [Intel SGX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html)
  - [ARM TrustZone](https://www.arm.com/technologies/trustzone-for-cortex-m)
  - Secure enclaves
  - Remote attestation

- **Applications**:
  - Confidential computing
  - Secure oracles
  - Private smart contracts
  - Secure key management

## Decentralized Storage

### IPFS Architecture

Many of the limitations of blockchain for data storage are inherent for the security needed for archiving consensus over the state of the blocks all across the network. The [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/) implementation differs from normal blockchains by removing the need for all nodes to store all the data, implementing a P2P network of storage providers that can share blocks of bytes between each other in a secure and decentralized way.

- **Components**:
  - Content addressing
  - DHT networking
  - BitSwap protocol
  - Pinning services

- **Integration**:
  - File upload/download
  - Content persistence
  - Gateway access
  - DNSLink

### Filecoin Integration

While the IPFS can handle all needs for communication, discovery and file sharing inside the protocol itself, it doesn't solve the incentivization aspect on itself. We can't expect storage providers to store and serve files for long time, incurring costs for hosting and network, without any kind of financial compensation.
For guaranteeing the longevity of file availability on these P2P networks, some sort of Data Availability solution needs to be implemented on top to incentivize correct behavior from all parts.
The [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/) network is one of many solutions that can provide this economic incentives on top of the file hosting and sharing operations.

- **Storage Markets**:
  - Deal making
  - Proof of Replication
  - Proof of Spacetime
  - Storage providers

- **Smart Contract Integration**:
  - Storage deals
  - Data retrieval
  - Payment channels
  - Verification
